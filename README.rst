conda-recipes
=============

This is my collection of homemade conda packages for python packages not yet
available through the default anaconda channels. For the most part, I've simply
followed the packaging instructions here:
http://conda.pydata.org/docs/build_tutorials/pkgs.html.

The built packages are hosted on my binstar account:
https://binstar.org/jesaerys.
