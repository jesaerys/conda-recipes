conda-recipes
=============

This is my collection of homemade conda package recipes for python packages not
yet available through the default anaconda channels. For the most part, I've
simply followed the packaging instructions here:
http://conda.pydata.org/docs/build_tutorials/pkgs.html.

Per the above link, recipes are built into packages using ``conda build
<recipe>``. The built packages are hosted on my binstar account:
https://binstar.org/jesaerys.
